Weaving and Coding
In this project, I explore the realtionship of weaving and coding. 
I find there are some similairties in the two different systems.
Weaving uses the language of weft and warp, which can be seemed as the binary system (0/1) used in the computer programming.
Also, the repitition in the process of weaving is the same as the loop function in coding.
Combining with the idea that the world created by computer is actually virtual, and it is a mirror world with the real world, I utilize the camera as a entry for the "mirror world". The patterns and movements created when we move in front of the camera can also be developed as a textile.
